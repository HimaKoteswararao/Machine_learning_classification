This project tackles a real problem I found fascinating: can machines learn to classify dry beans as accurately as human experts? Using machine learning on 13,611 bean samples, I trained four different algorithms to identify seven bean varieties based on physical features. Random Forest came out on top with 92.3% accuracy—not perfect, but solid enough to show potential for real-world use. The idea is simple: automate the tedious manual sorting that happens in agricultural facilities, making quality control faster and more consistent. It's my exploration into how AI can solve practical problems in industries we don't often think about. There's definitely room for improvement (hyperparameter tuning, more algorithms, better feature engineering), but it's a working proof-of-concept that demonstrates the possibilities of applying data science to agriculture.
